# Public Assembly DX Research

## **How It Works**

- Participants will be asked to complete curated tasks using the “DAO Utils” package. Every tasks asks participants to build a small app or add a single feature using our codebase. Each challenge takes no more than 1 hour and participants complete them on their own machine.
- These tasks are scenarios created to invoke problem solving around auction + proposal components, protocol hooks, as well as onchain theming.
- Loom makes it simple to add context to bugs and pull requests without ruining flow.
- The tasks will be located in a [repository](https://www.notion.so/PA-DX-UX-Research-PAP10-Experimental-Bug-Bounty-798d30a2c7e94843a711946fb03ffea7), individually designed to be completed in under an hour, and the open submission period for further feedback will be 2 weeks.
- Mostly everything happens on GitHub but communications are between the [forum working group](https://forum.public---assembly.com/g/Research-WG) and email.
- The preferred method of submission will be through pull request or issues on the official DAO utils repository, however feedback can also be sent within the forum.

## **Requirements**

---

- **Programming languages**
    - Currently the only languages we support are React, Typescript, and Solidity.
- GitHub
- Using Loom

## **Tasks**

---

**Closed ended**: *One Solution* **Open ended**:*Creative prompts, No right or wrong answers*

### **Moderated**

**Pair programming (Interviews?)** 

### **Unmoderated**

- Token Explorer and auctioning
- Proposals and Voting
- Onchain Theming

## **Time Frame**

---

Max 1 Hour on individual problems

---

**Compensation**

---

.25 ETH

## **Quickstart**

---

This guide will use PA task #1, but participants can choose one from the tasks by clicking [here.](https://www.notion.so/3cd8f7e66ffc43d6a65d7eec2b9feabc) 

**Fork the Repository**

1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), and [clone it](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
2. Complete the Task
    1. Follow the task instructions. Every task will be unique.
3. Report Bugs and Friction
    1. This is the whole point of the research. When participants encounter friction, confusion, or bugs, **open GitHub issues on the base repository**.

## **Submissions**

---

- Participants are expected to provide feedback in addition to reporting bugs.
- Feedback can include anything that causes friction when completing the goal, such as confusing documentation or time-wasting errors.
- Participants must attach screen recording clips to issues/PRs.
    - Recordings help moderators understand the context of the participant’s feedback and validate submissions.
- The survey at the end of the session will ask for ETH addresses and everything else.
- Post Survey which will ask them to include their wallet address and link to their PR with any further questions or feedback they may have on the experience.

## **Feedback**

---

People can file feedback for anything this "friction" to completing the task

- Things expected to work that didn't
- Confusing or outdated instructions
- Spelling and syntax errors in documentation and code samples
- Website UI that doesn't work

 Honest experiences will help maintainers improve their tools and remove friction for the next developer.

**What makes quality feedback?**

Note that all feedback should include a loom as well as a short description of the problem and experience.

- Identify specific areas where there were struggles, such as with understanding documentation or debugging an error
- Provide concrete suggestions for improving the developer experience, such as adding more examples to the documentation or clarifying ambiguous language
- Offer suggestions for alternative approaches or tools that may be more effective
- Be respectful and constructive, rather than critical or dismissive

**What are some examples of quality feedback?**

/example

> “At first, I tried installing through the plugin, but it kept throwing errors, despite installing it how the documentation said to. Then I switched to a maven project which, admittedly, I am not familiar with. Even then following documentation and examples online, it was not allowing me to download and execute the example getting started code.”
> 

> “Using my existing account/number/service plan didn't work through Java SDK, but does work through the button click online interface. When I released that account/number/service plan and created a fresh one, sending an SMS through the Java SDK worked.”
> 

> “Setting up the virtual number is confusing. Not sure if my phone number will suffix or do I really need a virtual number. Also, its not exactly clear how to create the virtual number on the site.”
> 

> “Message is always "This is a test message from your account", regardless of what message I put in when using the Java SDK. Is this a limitation of the trial account/free account? Or is it a bug? If the former, I didn't see it documented clearly anywhere.”
> 

**How does this work if solutions are public?**

This research is about honest individual feedback we give maintainers. Sure, people could copy feedback and solutions, but that's why we use loom to validate submissions.
